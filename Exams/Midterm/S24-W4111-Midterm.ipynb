    "\n",
    "1. the ArtistSong table represents the many-to-many relationship between artists and songs. No single column uniquely identifies a record since an artist can be associated with many songs and a song can have many artists. However, the combination of artist_id and song_id does uniquely identify each record, making it a composite primary key.\n",
    "2. The SongPlaylist table helps track which songs are in which playlists and for how long. Assuming that a song can only be added once at any given time, the combination of song_id and playlist_id serves as a composite primary key. \n",
    "3. A song can be added and removed from playlists multiple times. The date_added and date_removed fields in the SongPlaylist table are used to track these changes, with the understanding that a NULL in date_removed indicates the song is currently in the playlist.\n",
    "4. Requirement 2: to implement the tracking of current and previous reviews, as well as their dates, the Review table includes review_date. This allows tracking when the review was made. To handle multiple reviews by the same user for the same album, Use the review_date to identify the most recent review. Assume that only the most recent review per user per album is \"active\" or \"current\". Older reviews remain in the table for historical tracking but are not considered the active review. This historical tracking is done by maintaining all entries in the Review table but recognizing the one with the latest date for each user-album pair as the current review.\n",
    "5. Requirement 3: The SongPlaylist associative entity tracks the songs in playlists over time with date_added and date_removed attributes. For the current songs in a playlist, date_removed would be NULL. This setup allows the system to see which songs were in a playlist at any historical point in time based on the date range they were added and removed. It supports querying for all songs in a playlist where the current date is between the date_added and date_removed (or date_removed is NULL) to find the current songs in a playlist. This also allows tracking the history of a playlist's composition."
