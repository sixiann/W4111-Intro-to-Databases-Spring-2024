An alternate approach could be letting students, faculty, administrators, etc. use shared Google Sheets to create, retrieve, update, and delete information. What are some problems with the shared spread sheet approach and what functions do DMBS implement to solve the problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Security problems: It is hard to provide user access to some,  but not all, data. Access would need to be carefully controlled to prevent instances where an unauthorized user modifies information they should not be able to modify. For example, students choose to change their own grades or other students' grades to whatever score they want. DBMS solves this problem by having security features like user authentication, role-based access control, and encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Concurrent Access by multiple users: Uncontrolled concurrent access can lead to inconsistencies in data or even loss of data. DBMS use locking mechanisms and transaction management to ensure data integrity during concurrent access. \n",

Scalability and performance: Spreadsheets may not be able to scale to the large number of students, faculty, and administrators in the school, and the large amount of data that needs to be tracked.
