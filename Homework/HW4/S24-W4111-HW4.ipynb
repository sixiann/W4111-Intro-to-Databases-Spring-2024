This discrepancy arises because objects in code do not neatly map onto the tabular structure of relational databases, requiring additional effort to translate between the two models (e.g., using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools). NoSQL databases, with their more flexible data models (such as document, key-value, graph), often align more closely with the object-oriented approach, reducing or eliminating the impedance mismatch and simplifying the interaction between application code and the database."
